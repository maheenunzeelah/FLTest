**A testbed for evaluating the privacy and robustness of Privacy-Preserving Federated
Learning (PPFL).** FLTest gives *software-defined control and visibility* into FL testing.
One YAML config runs the same experiment across several FL frameworks, injects attacks and
defenses as composable hooks, and applies differential testing, metamorphic testing, and a
pitfall checker.

FLTest is the **NSF PDaSP (Track 3) FLTEST project** — *A Testbed for Enhancing Privacy and
Robustness of Federated Learning Systems* — supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation
(**Award #2452817-19**).

## Why

A survey of 50 FL robustness papers found wildly inconsistent setups (MNIST-only, IID-only,
naive attacks, no personalized metrics), which inflates privacy/robustness claims. FLTest
makes a rigorous setup the default and *checks* for the common pitfalls.

## Highlights

- **One abstraction, many backends.** Every FL framework implements a single
  `run_simulation()` adapter. Built in: a dependency-light **reference** PyTorch FedAvg
  oracle, **Flower**, and **NVFlare** (optional extra).
- **Everything is a hook.** Attacks, defenses, and metric listeners are hook plugins that
  share one `HookContext`. A plugin written once runs across every backend, and several
  plugins compose on a single run.
- **Attacks:** `label_flip`, `sign_flip`, `gaussian`, `backdoor` and `model_replacement`
  (with attack-success-rate), `little_is_enough` (Byzantine attack sized to the honest
  clients' own variance, so robust aggregation keeps selecting it), `dlg`
  (gradient-inversion privacy attack), and `membership_inference` (loss-threshold privacy
  attack, scored as AUC each round).
- **Defenses (PPFL):** `gradient_noise` (DP-style clip+noise), `norm_clip`, robust
  aggregation `krum` / `trimmed_mean` / `median`, and secure aggregation
  `secure_aggregation` (float pairwise masking) / `mpc_aggregation` (fixed point in a
  finite ring, which surfaces quantization, overflow, and dropout errors). `fldetector`
  names the malicious clients and excludes them, rather than out-voting them each round.
- **Differential testing:** same config across frameworks must agree within tolerance
  (cross-framework parity); or the same spec run twice must be identical (determinism).
- **Metamorphic testing:** `clients_scale` (N→2N), `rounds_monotonic`, `attack_strength`,
  `dp_noise`, and `secagg_lossless` — an exact-equality oracle: a secure-aggregation mask
  seed must leave the global model bit-identical.
- **Pitfall checker + recommender:** flags the six FL-evaluation pitfalls from the project
  and emits copy-pasteable counter-experiments.
- **Config fuzzer:** any list-valued knob (e.g. `dataset: [mnist, cifar10]`) is expanded
  into a grid of runs.
- **Datasets:** `mnist`, `fashion_mnist`, `cifar10`, `cifar100`, and `femnist`, which is
  partitioned by writer and naturally non-IID. Text is supported through `ag_news`, and any
  Hugging Face image-classification id also works by name.
- **Models:** built-in `LeNet` / `ConvNet` / `MLP`, torchvision architectures such as
  `ResNet18` and `MobileNetV3`, and Hub models written as `hf:<id>`.

## Install (isolated conda env)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml      # creates env "fltest" (Python 3.11)
conda activate fltest
pip install -e ".[dev]"                   # core (reference + Flower) + test tooling
pip install -e ".[nvflare]"               # optional NVFlare backend (needs Python <=3.11)
pip install -e ".[hf]"                    # optional Hugging Face models and text datasets
```

CPU is the default and is deterministic; `device: mps` (Apple Silicon) or `device: cuda`
are selectable for speed (with the usual GPU non-determinism caveat).

An Intel Mac constrains the Hugging Face extra, because PyTorch publishes no macOS x86_64
wheel past 2.2.2. See [installation](docs/installation.md) for what that pins.

## Use

```bash
fltest list          # available frameworks/attacks/defenses/metrics

# the attack and defense matrix, on CIFAR-10, with two privacy scenarios
fltest run examples/configs/exhaustive_eval.yaml

# privacy: what the model leaks, and what DP noise costs to stop it
fltest run examples/configs/membership_inference.yaml
fltest run examples/configs/dlg.yaml               # gradient inversion
fltest run examples/configs/model_replacement.yaml # boosted backdoor, reference + Flower
fltest run examples/configs/little_is_enough.yaml  # Byzantine attack that Krum still selects
fltest run examples/configs/little_is_enough_defenses.yaml # how much each rule concedes
fltest run examples/configs/secure_agg.yaml        # DLG vs no defense / DP noise / masking
fltest run examples/configs/mpc_aggregation.yaml   # what the finite ring costs: quantization, overflow, dropouts

# detection: name the attackers instead of out-voting them
fltest run examples/configs/fldetector.yaml

# heterogeneity: one client per real writer, and one topic per client
fltest run examples/configs/femnist_natural.yaml
fltest run examples/configs/text_domains.yaml      # needs the [hf] extra

# the testing engines
fltest diff        examples/configs/differential_cifar10_3way.yaml
fltest metamorphic examples/configs/metamorphic.yaml
fltest pitfalls    examples/configs/pitfalls_demo.yaml
```

Loadable hook files (slide-style), no config edits:

```bash
export FLTEST_HOOKS=examples/hooks/atk_dlg,examples/hooks/def_gradient_noise
fltest run examples/configs/dlg.yaml
```

## Config sketch (`test_conf.yaml`)

```yaml
name: my_eval
dataset: [mnist, cifar10]        # a list => fuzzed into a grid
data_distribution: [iid, dirichlet]
model_name: LeNet
num_clients: 10
num_rounds: 10
attacks:  [{name: backdoor, params: {infection_rate: 0.3}, target_clients: [0,1]}]
defenses: [{name: median}]
metrics:  [accuracy, loss, per_client]
runs:                            # one per framework => cross-framework differential
  - {framework: reference}
  - {framework: flwr}
  - {framework: nvflare}
testing:
  differential: {mode: cross_framework, metric: accuracy, tolerance: 0.05}
  metamorphic:
    - {relation: clients_scale, values: [10, 20], tolerance: 0.05}
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -q
```

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the design and `examples/configs/` for runnable configs.

## Notes & limitations

- **NVFlare** accepts built-in models only, since it rebuilds the model from its class
  path and cannot serialise a torchvision constructor argument.
- **NVFlare** runs each client in its own simulator process, so client-side hooks at
  `before_client_train` and `after_client_train` do not apply to it. That backend is used
  for cross-framework differential parity of the vanilla FedAvg path. The reference and Flower
  backends support the full hook surface.
- **DLG** `source: gradient` (default) demonstrates raw-gradient invertibility. The
  `source: shared_update` mode (reconstruct from the uploaded update) is faithful only
  under single-step (FedSGD) training.
- A `Dockerfile` (CPU, Linux) is provided as a deliverable; the verified path is the conda
  env above.
