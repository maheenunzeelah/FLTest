"""Attack (threat model) plugins, implemented as composable hooks.

Importing this package declares all built-in attacks in
:data:`fltest.core.registry.ATTACKS` so they are usable by name from a config. The
declarations are lazy: each implementing module is imported the first time its attack is
requested, so importing this package does not pull in torch.
