"""A Little Is Enough: a Byzantine attack sized to the honest population's own spread.

Baruch, Baruch and Goldberg, *A Little Is Enough: Circumventing Defenses For Distributed
Learning* (NeurIPS 2019).

``gaussian`` and ``sign_flip`` perturb an update without reference to what the honest
updates look like, so any perturbation large enough to matter is also an outlier — which is
exactly the signal ``krum``, ``median`` and ``trimmed_mean`` key on. This attack measures
the benign population first and moves only as far as that population's own variance allows,
per coordinate:

``u' = mu - z * sigma``

With ``n`` participants and ``m`` attackers, ``s = floor(n/2 + 1) - m`` benign workers are
needed to complete a majority. A value ``z`` deviations out is covered by the
``(n - m) * (1 - Phi(z))`` honest workers lying further out still, so staying hidden needs
``(n - m) * (1 - Phi(z)) >= s``, i.e. ``Phi(z) <= (n - m - s) / (n - m)``; the default ``z``
is the largest value satisfying it. The crafted update therefore still falls inside the range
a majority of honest workers occupy: a distance-based rule keeps accepting it while the
aggregate drifts a little every round. Set ``z`` explicitly to sweep attack strength.

``sigma`` is the population standard deviation (NumPy's default). Reimplementations built on
``torch.std`` use the sample form, which is larger by ``sqrt(k / (k - 1))`` over ``k`` benign
clients, so the same ``z`` is a slightly wider step there than here.

Threat model: the paper's *full-knowledge* attacker, which sees the round's benign updates.
The attack runs at ``before_aggregate``, where FLTest exposes every submission, and rewrites
only the attackers' entries. Attacks attach before defenses, so a robust aggregator in the
same config still sees the crafted updates. NVFlare does not emit ``before_aggregate`` and
cannot run this attack.
