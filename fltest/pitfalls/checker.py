"""Pitfall checker: heuristic detectors for the six FL-evaluation pitfalls.

Maps directly onto the pitfalls catalogued in the proposal (Section 3.1). Each detector
inspects a :class:`TestConfig` (the planned evaluation) and emits a :class:`Finding` when
the setup risks over-estimating privacy/robustness. The recommender turns findings into
concrete counter-experiments.
