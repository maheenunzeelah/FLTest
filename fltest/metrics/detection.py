"""Detection quality: did a defense flag the clients the config actually attacked?

A detector's accuracy column measures the model, not the detection. A run whose accuracy
recovers after exclusion has *probably* flagged the right clients, but a detector that
flagged one honest client alongside the attackers would produce nearly the same curve.
This listener compares the flagged set against the ground truth the config already
carries, so the claim is measured rather than read off an accuracy trace.

Ground truth is the union of ``target_clients`` over the attacks that make a client
malicious. Server-side privacy attacks are excluded from that union: ``dlg`` and
``membership_inference`` name a *victim*, not an attacker, so counting them would mark
an honest client as one the detector should have caught.
